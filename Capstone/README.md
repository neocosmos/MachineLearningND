Libraries and tools: Python 2.7  
Jupyter Notebook: create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations.  
Scikit-learn: simple and efficient open-source tools for data mining and data analysis  
Tensor-flow: open-source software library for Machine Intelligence.   
Keras: high-level neural networks library, written in Python and capable of running on top of either TensorFlow or Theano.

This project only deals with face recognition. The face detection part uses the tool which can be downloaded from http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/archive/CNN/
